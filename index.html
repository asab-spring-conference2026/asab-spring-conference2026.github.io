    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
Welcome to website for the <a href="https://www.asab.org/">Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour</a>&rsquo;s Spring Conference 2026. This year, the conference will be held at the University of Bristol in the beautiful southwest of England, on <b>Tuesday 24th and Wednesday 25th March</b>. There will also be a <b>workshop</b> preceding the conference, on <b>Monday 23rd March</b>, on the theme of 'ethics and integrity in animal behaviour research'.
</p>
<p>
The Spring conference is traditionally a postgraduate and ECR-focussed conference, and is a gentle, relaxed introduction to the conference circuit for many early career scientists, with career training available in the workshop and during the conference. It&rsquo;s an excellent way to build a network of peers within the animal behaviour community.
</p>
<p>
The conference will be held on the main campus of the University of Bristol, in the thriving student heart of the city. The University of Bristol has a rich and vibrant history of animal behaviour research, with research primarily focussed in the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/research/behaviour/">School of Biological Sciences</a> and the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/vet-school/research/welfare-behaviour/">Bristol Veterinary School</a>, with research links to many other departments in the University, and we look forward to welcoming you to our beautiful city.
